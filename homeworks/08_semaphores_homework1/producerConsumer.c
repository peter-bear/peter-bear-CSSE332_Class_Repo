/**
   In this system, there are 2 types of threads - producers and
   consumers.  Producers write integers to the shared data buffer.
   Consumers read integers from the shared data buffer.  Everybody has
   to be careful when modifying the buffer and the integer that keeps track
   of how many elements are in the buffer.

   When the producers are being slow (i.e. the buffer is empty) the
   consumers should be blocked by a semaphore.  You can simulate this
   by uncommenting the sleep in the producer code.

   When the consumers are being slow (i.e. the buffer is full) the
   producers should be blocked by a semaphore.  You can simulate this
   by uncommenting the sleep in the consumer code.

   It does not matter the order the items are consumed (i.e. it does
   not need to be the same as the order they were produced).
   
   Here's what I would suggest, attempt to figure it out and make a
   first stab at writing the code.  Then, if you get stuck - check out
   the treatmeant in the little book of semaphores (pg 73):
