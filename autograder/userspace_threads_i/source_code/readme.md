## Introduction and aim
We are going to do plenty of C programming in this class, and to do so, I
believe it would be helpful to have a refresher on pointers in C. 

In this short assignment, you will do some pointer practice to refresh your
memory and bring out some of the concepts you learned in CSSE 132 into your
memory. If you remember all that well, I would expect it would take you about an
hour to complete this assignment. If your syntax is a bit rusty, then this will
serve as great practice for the class. 

## Logistics
* [Source directory](https://github.com/rhit-csse332/csse332/tree/main/homeworks/00_pointer_practice)
* Submit on [gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/334393)
* [Submission instructions]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/submission_instructions/)


## Problems and solving them
There are five problems of increasing difficulty with included test cases. The
only file you need to concern yourself with is `main.c`, but please do not edit
any of the test cases. 

You can solve these problems in one of two ways:
1. If you've got a working C Linux environment, you can go ahead and get started
   directly. If you do not but are not afraid to install a Linux virtual machine
   (or in some other form), that will be one of the first things we do in class,
   so feel free to get a head start. 
2. You can also do this assignment completely online in a web-based C
   programming environment [here](https://repl.it/@RHITcsse/OSPointerPractice).

<!--
If you won't have time or computer access during the break, this assignment will
be due on the second day of the term (Friday), so you can try to squeeze it
during our work time in class. If you have any questions, please reach out via
Email or Teams as soon as possible.

## Submission
Once you complete the assignment, you can submit your code via Gradescope.

For you convenience, here is a link to the [submission instructions]({{ site.baseurl
