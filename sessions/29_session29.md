# Introduction and aim

In this session, we will take a look at the ways in which an operation system
can handle the problem of deadlocks occurring in a user application. 
There are three main techniques that we will discuss in this lecture:
1. The ostrich algorithm: basically do nothing about deadlocks.
1. Deadlock avoidance: using the Banker's algorithm
1. Deadlock detection and recovery
