# Introduction and aim

In this session, we will continue our discussion of control flow hijacking
attacks. We will use the first two problems of our assignment as a practical
introduction to implementation control flow hijacking attacks. We will then
discuss ways to mitigate such attacks by focusing on the two steps needed to
implement them.
