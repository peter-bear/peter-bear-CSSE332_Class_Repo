# Introduction and aim

In this session, we will dive deeper into concurrency bugs and look at the most
prominent form of such bugs, the deadlock. We will see that a deadlock can occur
when the following four conditions are met:
1. Mutual exclusion
1. Hold-and-wait
1. No preemption
1. Circular wait

We will define each of these conditions and then look at how we can prevent
deadlocks by tackling each of those four conditions.
