# Introduction and aim
In this session, we will do a quick review of some of the basic concepts in C, specifically
pointers, void pointers, memory management, and function pointers.

# Announcements
In this first short video, we will make a few announcements and set out our aim for this session.

# Pointers review
In this video, we will go over C pointers and review some of their basic concepts. We will also talk
about void pointers, which are C pointers that can point to _anything_.

<iframe src="https://rose-hulman.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=5f0a732f-dc33-4a9b-8188-ace70155a1d8&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=false&start=0&interactivity=all" height="360" width="640" style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay"></iframe>

Below is a short demo that shows the above concepts in action. This demo is optional if you are
comfortable with your pointers.

# Pointer arithmetic
In this video, we talk about pointer arithmetic and dive into the details of what happens when we
increment pointers, both typed pointers and void pointers.

<iframe src="https://rose-hulman.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=13582d53-b225-47a6-ae8a-ace80005460d&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=false&start=0&interactivity=all" height="360" width="640" style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay"></iframe>

There is also a short demo to accompany the pointer arithmetic concepts. Feel free to skip it if you
are comfortable with pointer arithmetic.

# Memory management
In this video, we talk about `malloc` and `free`, the main ways to allocate and deallocate _dynamic_
memory in C.

_This video include a bonus voice appearance by Herman the cat who was not particularly happy with
the fact that I locked him out of the room. I guess he wanted to learn about memory management in C
as well_.

# Function pointers
Finally, we revisit the concept of function pointers that allow us to dynamically change which
function is called based on which function our pointer addresses.
