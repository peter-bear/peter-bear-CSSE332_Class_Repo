# Introduction and aim
In this session, we will define what a process is and what a thread is. We will discuss how the
operating system represents processes using _process control blocks_ and examine how context
switching happens (i.e., what happens when we called `swap_context`). There is short quiz at the end
of the session in addition to our normal clear/muddy survey.

# Motivating example
We kick things off with a small motivating example: what happens when your instructor is trying to
do some work prepping for the CSSE332 sessions?

# Processes: A definition
In this video, we define what we do actually mean when we say process. In short, a process is
nothing but a program __in execution__. We examine how a process is loaded from a given program (or
binary) and then look at what memory segments are needed for executing a process.

# Threads: A definition
After defining processes, we take a look at threads, a more ''light-weight'' units of execution that
share an address space with the process that spawns them, and withing themselves. We end the video
with a small demo in which we look at the memory segments of a process in action.

# Context switching
After setting up our definitions, we examine what do we when we say context switching. What happens
when we must switch from one process or thread to another.

# The PCB and the process states
Finally, we introduce the process control block (PCB) that the operating system uses to maintain all
the information of a certain process. We examine Linux's `task_struct` as an example and check out
its contents. 

We then take a look at the states in which a process can be. We see that a process can be in one of
three states:
* `RUNNING`: When the process is actively running on the CPU
* `READY`: When the process is ready to executes but does not have ownership over the CPU
* `WAITING`: When the process is waiting for a certain even to happen
We finally see those states in action by examining a small demo.
