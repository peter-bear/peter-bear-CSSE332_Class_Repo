/**
   In this system, there are 3 printer threads and one application
   thread.  The application generates strings that must be printed by
   a printer.  To do a print, the application puts a string pointer in
   the thingToPrint global variable and then (somehow) signals that it
   is ready to print.  A single printer thread then takes the
   thingToPrint and begins printing it.  The application should not
   modify thingToPrint while the printer thread is reading it - but
   once printing starts it can submit jobs to the other print threads.
   If the application wants to submit a job but all the printers are
   in use, the application should wait.

   Write a solution using semaphores that enforces these constraints.
