/*
 * In this problem, we will try to perform the vector dot product operation in a
 * parallel manner. The dot product of two arrays is simply the sum of the
 * products of their elements. For example, if v1 = [1,2,3] and v2=[3,4,5] then
 * the dot product is equal to 1*3 + 2*4 + 3*5 = 3 + 8 + 15 = 26.
 *
 * This question refers to the following components:
 *	- v1: an input array of size VEC_SIZE
 *	- v2: another input array of size VEC_SIZE
 *	- temp: a temporary array to hold the element-by-element product of v1
 *		and v2
 *	- result: the sum of the elements in the array temp.
 *
 *
 * For simplicity, we will perform this action in two steps, we first compute
 * the element by element product of both arrays and store that in temp, and
 * then sum the element of temp and save the outcome in the result variable.
 *
 * We already provide you with code to perform these two steps sequentially.
 * Your job is to parallelize these two functions so that we can run the code in
 * parallel.
 *
 * STEP 1: PARALLELIZE `product_handler`
 *
 * We will first start by adding code to parallelize the element-by-element
 * product operation. Take a look at the sequential code that is provided for
 * you and make sure you understand it. Ask questions if you need to.
 *
 * Do the following:
 * - Add code to the `product_handler` function to make it runnable by pthreads.
 *   When run as a thread function, a pthread will pass a non-NULL pointer as
 *   the input argument to this function.
 * - Add code in the main function to set up pthreads (including create and
 *   join). After joining pthreads, add one line of code `sum_handler(NULL);` to
 *   cal the sum function to run sequentially after the product has been
 *   computed.
 * - Uncomment the code that measures the run-time and prints out the time cost.
 *   The time cost SHOULD INCLUDE the thread creation, the computation of the
 *   temp array, and the summation of temp using `sum_handler(NULL);`.
 *
 * After you complete this step, the output of this program should look like:
 *	$ ./dotproduct
 *	Non-parallel method computed dot product in 42697 uses.
 *	Parallel method computed dot product in 35680 uses.
 *
 *
 * STEP 2: PARALLELIZE `sum_handler`
 *
 * In this step, we will add code to parallelize the summation of the elements
 * in the temp array. First, take a look at the code in `sum_handler` and make
 * sure you understand it. Ask questions if you need to.
 *
 * Similar to the previous step, you need to add code to the `sum_handler`
 * function as well as in main (to create and join the pthreads).
 *
 * To maximize parallelism, you MUST create (i.e., call `pthread_create`) all
 * pthreads (NUM_PRODUCT_THREADS product threads and NUM_SUM_THREADS sum
 * threadS).
 *
 * However, there are two things we must take care of in this case:
 * 1. A sum thread should should wait until the part of temp that it must sum is
 *    ready. In other words, the sum thread should not run until the product
 *    thread that generates the part of temp that it is responisble for has
 *    already completed.
 * 2. There is a race condition on the `result` variable if you try to use the
 *    code that we provide you use as is. You need to use semaphores to synchronize
 *    access to the the `result` variable. (Hint: we have done this problem or
 *    something similar in class).
 *
 * After completing this step, you should see:
 *
 *	$ ./dotproduct
 *	Non-parallel method computed dot product in 42798 uses.
 *	Parallel method computed dot product in 35790 uses.
 *
 * As you can see, we didn't gain too much in terms of parallelism, but we had
 * some fun and practice ;)
