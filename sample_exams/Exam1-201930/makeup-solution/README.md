# Exam 1 Makeup: Fork, Exec, etc.

So in this exam we want to build a system to benchmark interprocess
communication over pipes.  We have several senders and receivers and
wish to measure the time it takes to communicate a standard set of
messages from the sender to the receiver.  The basic idea is to test
each sender-receiver pair in parallel and if the test successfully
completed, report the time required.

**NOTE** We have ordered the steps in what we think is the most
convenient implementation order.  If you have difficulty with one step
though, some of them can be completed out of order so you can try the
later parts too.

# Makefile (10 points)

So we're going to use several extra executables for this problem:
fast\_receiver, fast\_sender, slow\_receiver, slow\_sender,
unreliable\_receiver, and unreliable\_sender.  Each of these includes
common.h and uses functions in common.c.  makescript will build all of
these extra executables except slow\_sender.  You can compile
slow\_sender them by hand like this:

	gcc -o slow_sender slow_sender.c common.c
    
But that is inefficient.  Make a makefile that builds slow\_sender
using the 2-step process (i.e. compile each .c file to a .o
individually, then link the .o files into an executable).  For max
credit, your system should only rebuild what is necessary based on
when files are updated.

Feel free to further enhance your Makefile to build the other five
executables (perhaps by calling makescript) and para\_benchmark (the
file you'll be editing for this assignment), but only slow\_sender
will be looked at in terms of grading the Makefile.

# Running in parallel (20 points)

You can compile the given code like this (again, feel free to add
this to your Makefile if you want):

    gcc para_benchmark.c common.c -o para_benchmark

You can run the executable like this:

    ./para_benchmark

And the output you see should look like this:

	prompt> ./para_benchmark
	I would like to test ./fast_receiver with ./fast_sender
	Done testing ./fast_sender with ./fast_receiver, 1.000103 sec required
	I would like to test ./fast_receiver with ./slow_sender
	Done testing ./slow_sender with ./fast_receiver, 1.000138 sec required
	I would like to test ./slow_receiver with ./fast_sender
	Done testing ./fast_sender with ./slow_receiver, 1.000140 sec required
	I would like to test ./slow_receiver with ./slow_sender
	Done testing ./slow_sender with ./slow_receiver, 1.000140 sec required
	prompt> 

You should notice a few problems:

1. The code is just saying it would like to run test a sender and
   receiver, but not actually running them.
2. The code is not reporting the time required for each combination.
3. The code is not running in parallel.  It performs each test one at a time.

To start with, use fork to solve problem #3.  Your output should look
like this:

	prompt> ./para_benchmark
	I would like to test ./fast_receiver with ./fast_sender
	I would like to test ./fast_receiver with ./slow_sender
	I would like to test ./slow_receiver with ./fast_sender
	I would like to test ./slow_receiver with ./slow_sender
	prompt> Done testing ./fast_sender with ./fast_receiver, 1.000124 sec required
	Done testing ./slow_sender with ./fast_receiver, 1.000125 sec required
	Done testing ./fast_sender with ./slow_receiver, 1.000106 sec required
	Done testing ./slow_sender with ./slow_receiver, 1.000089 sec required

In this example, the child processes are the ones printing "done
testing ...." messages.

Note that the order of the sender-receiver pairs could well be
different (they are happening in parallel after all).  The key is that
all the "I would like to test ...." messages print before any of the
"done testing ...." messages.

**NOTE:** The parent does not need to wait for the children to
complete before exiting. Eventually, you'll need to do this, but it's
not required for this part.  If you don't wait though, you might see
the prompt print before all the "Done testing ...." messages (as it
does in my example).  That's fine.  If you did make the parent wait
though, that's fine too.

# Exec the sender (20 points)

Use exec to make your forked children actually invoke the appropriate
sender.  The senders require a command line argument.  For this part,
simply pass in -1.  You do not need to print out the "Done testing
...." message with the timing data.  We'll add that in the next part.
You also don't need to preserve the sleep -- it's built in to the
senders.

In addition, have the parent wait until all of the children are
complete and print "Testing complete."

Your output should look like this:

	prompt> ./para_benchmark
	testing ./slow_sender
	waiting for all tests to complete
	testing ./fast_sender
	testing ./slow_sender
	testing ./fast_sender
	starting slow_sender
	starting fast_sender
	starting slow_sender
	starting fast_sender
	slow_sender: fake mode (slow)
	slow_sender: fake mode (slow)
	fast_sender: fake mode
	fast_sender: fake mode
	Testing complete
	prompt> 

**NOTE:** This part and the next are closely related and it may help
to think about them together.

# Collect benchmark data (15 points)

Measure the time it takes for each sender to execute and restore the
"Done testing ...." message.  Do this by introducing an additional
fork that starts the timer, forks and execs the child sender process,
waits for it to complete, and then prints timing information.

Your output should look like this:

	prompt> ./para_benchmark
    testing ./fast_sender
    waiting for all tests to complete
    waiting for ./fast_sender to finish
    testing ./slow_sender
    waiting for ./slow_sender to finish
    testing ./fast_sender
    waiting for ./fast_sender to finish
    starting fast_sender
    testing ./slow_sender
    waiting for ./slow_sender to finish
    starting slow_sender
    starting fast_sender
    starting slow_sender
    fast_sender: fake mode
    Done testing ./fast_sender with ./fast_receiver, 1.000860 sec required
    fast_sender: fake mode
    Done testing ./fast_sender with ./slow_receiver, 1.000907 sec required
    slow_sender: fake mode (slow)
    Done testing ./slow_sender with ./fast_receiver, 2.000973 sec required
    slow_sender: fake mode (slow)
    Done testing ./slow_sender with ./slow_receiver, 2.000999 sec required
    Testing complete
	prompt> 

Note that we've made the slower processes run slower than the fast
ones, even in fake mode, so you should see output consistent with
above.

**NOTE:** This part and the previous one are closely related and it may help
to think about them together.

# Exec the receiver (10 points)

Use exec to make your forked children also invoke the appropriate
receiver.  The receivers will eventually need a command line argument,
but for now do not pass a command line argument.  Make sure you
measure the time it takes for each sender-receiver pair to run and
print the results in the "Done testing ...." message.

Your output should look like this:

	prompt> ./para_benchmark
    testing ./fast_sender with ./fast_receiver
    waiting for all tests to complete
    waiting for ./fast_sender and ./fast_receiver to finish

# Shared memory and dealing with failures (15 points)

In this step of the process we want determine the fastest overall send
receive pair.  Once all the parallel tests have finished the parent
should print "The fastest overall runtime was XXXXXXX seconds".

Use shared memory to allow the children to communicate the benchmark
results to the parent.  Create an array of doubles with mmap() and
modify the children to store the time required for each benchmark test
in the array.

When a sender or receiver fails it's important that it's result not be
used to calculate the final best time.  Check the exit status of the
sender or receiver in each pair and if either are unsuccessful enter
-1 into the array.  To check unsuccessful tests you can include
unreliable\_sender and unreliable\_receiver in your testing pairs by
changing nrcvr and nsndrs to 3.

After all the children have completed, the parent should be able to
iterate through the array and find the smallest best time (obviously
avoiding any -1s).

# Create a pipe and pass the file descriptor to the sender and receiver (10 points)

Remember that when processes are forked one of the few things that the
child shares with the parent are open files.  We will take advantage
of this using pipes to allow interprocess communication.  Create a
pipe and pass the appropriate file descriptor to the sender and
receiver on the command line instead of -1.  

To send the pipe file descriptors to the execed processes we
must pass them as strings.  Here's how to convert:

    char data[100];
    snprintf(data, 100, "%d", fds[0]);

Note that your process must close unused fd ends before execing.  Also
be sure to close both ends of the pipe in the parent or you can get a
bug where the receivers never finish.
