/*
 * In a water park, people take a canoe for a short tour for fun. Here are some
 * constraints/regulations we have to work with when coordinating the canoe
 * tour.
 * 
 * 1) There is only one canoe in this park, i.e., only one tour at a time. 
 * 
 * 2) The tourists include both adults and kids (different pthreads in our
 * program). An adult can ride the canoe alone, while a cannot. A kid must take
 * the tour with an adult. The capacity of the canoe is exactly one adult or one
 * adult and one kid. 
 * 
 * 3) Assume all the adults are fiendly that always voluntarily take a kid with
 * them if there is a kid waiting. However, if there is no kid waiting when an
 * adult starts the tour, the adult can go alone without delay and wait.
 * 
 * 4) In the kid and adult functions, both will print out messages before and
 * after finishing a tour. Particularly, for the adult function, it will print
 * out different messages after finishing canoeing to identify whether or not
 * this adult took the tour with a kid.
 * 
 * Hint: I used a total of 2 mutex locks and one condition variable to solve
 * this problem.
 * 
 * Here is a sample output that I got from running my solution:
 * 
 *  $ ./canoe
