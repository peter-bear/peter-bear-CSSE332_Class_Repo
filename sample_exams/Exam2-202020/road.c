/**

So in this system, we imagine a road that narrows down to one lane at
a particular point.  There are two types of threads in the system,
southbound cars and northbound cars.

The rules are:

If there are no cars on the one-lane road, any car can enter.

If there is a southbound car on the one-lane road, any number of
southbound cars can enter but no northbound cards.

If there is a northbound car on the one-lane road, any number of
northbound cars can enter but no southbound cards.

Note that this system has the possibility of starvation - that is, if
southbound cards keep arriving nothbound may never get a chance.
That's OK.
