/* In this problem you will be adding code mostly to 2 files--this
 * file and solver.c. The shm module has all the code and data
 * structures that you need for working with shared memory (take a
 * look at shm.c for what we've provided). You are expected to modify
 * the sharedMemoryStruct as needed. That's the only change you need
 * to make in the shm module.
 * 
 * STEP 1 (4 points)
 * Begin in this file by creating a shared memory region and attaching
 * it to its address space. The shared memory key is stored in shm.h.
 * 
 * 
 * Next, prompt the user for 4 coordinates in the form x1, y1, x2, y2.
 * This is already done for you in the main function below.
 * 
 * Save the coordinates in the shared memory region. This is where
 * you should modify the sharedMemoryStruct to do so.
 * 
 * STEP 2 (3 points)
 * Create a new child process using fork() to run the solver program.
 * 
 * STEP 3 (7 points)
 * solver should use the shared memory key to attach the shared memory
 * region to its address space.  solver should then use the coordinates
 * stored in shared memory to compute the slope and intercept of the line
 * segment connecting the points defined by the coordinates.  See solver.c
 * more more details.
 * 
 * STEP 4 (3 points)
 * After solver exits, this program should display to the console the equation
 * of the line connecting the points defined by the coordinates in shared
 * memory.
 * 
 * 
 * STEP 5 (3 points)
 * This program should then detach the shared memory region from its address 
 * space and remove it.  Note: detaching a shared memory region is not the same
 * as removing it.
 * 
 * Here's what a the results for a sample run of this program looks like:
 * 
 * 
 *  >> ./main
    Enter coordinates for 2 points as comma separated list of numbers: x1, y1, x2, y2:
    2, 5, 4, 13
    main saved your coordinates in shared memory region...

    Starting linear equation solver...
    Receive points (2.00, 5.00), (4.00, 13.00)
    Saving slope and intercept...
    linear equation solver has exited...
    equation: y = 4.00x + -3.00

    main has detached its shared memory region...
    main has removed its shared memory region...
    main is exiting...
