 * Display to the console the points representing the 2

 *
 * (4 points)
 * Use the coordinates to compute the slope and intercept of
 * the line segment that joins the points defined by the 
 * coordinate. It might he beneficial to declare and use a 
 * separate function to compute each.
 * 
 * Just a reminder:
 * - Linear equation: y = mx + c
 * - Slope equation: m = (y2 -y1)/(x2 - x1)
 * - Intercept is represented as 'c' in the linear equation 
 * 
 * Save the slope and intercept in the shared memory region.
 * 
 * (1 point)
 * Detach the shared memory region from this process's
 * address space.
