/*

  In this system there are NUM_PRINTERS 3D printers numbered 0 1 etc.
  
  Any printer can print any job, but each job must be sent to exactly
  one printer.  Once a printer is working a job, no additional jobs
  can be sent to that printer until the job finishes.  The system
  needs to print which printer a parituclar job is assigned to (but,
  if there's more than one printer available, it doesn't matter which
  printer gets assigned the job).

  We want to ensure that a job is never sent to a printer that is
  currently working another job.  We also want to ensure maximal
  resource utilization - i.e. a job is never waiting while there is
  some printer avilable.  

  For full credit, this solution should work without busywaits
  (i.e. unassigned jobs should not be constantly reading memory while
  they wait for a printer to become available).

  Note that the jobs are not required to start/complete in any
  particular order (e.g. note e starts after f in the example).

  Example output:

Job 'a' assigned to printer 0
Job 'b' assigned to printer 1
Job 'c' assigned to printer 2
Job 'b' finished, printer 1 free
Job 'd' assigned to printer 1
Job 'a' finished, printer 0 free
Job 'f' assigned to printer 0
Job 'c' finished, printer 2 free
Job 'h' assigned to printer 2
Job 'd' finished, printer 1 free
Job 'g' assigned to printer 1
Job 'f' finished, printer 0 free
Job 'e' assigned to printer 0
Job 'h' finished, printer 2 free
Job 'i' assigned to printer 2
Job 'e' finished, printer 0 free
Job 'j' assigned to printer 0
Job 'g' finished, printer 1 free
Job 'i' finished, printer 2 free
Job 'j' finished, printer 0 free
done
