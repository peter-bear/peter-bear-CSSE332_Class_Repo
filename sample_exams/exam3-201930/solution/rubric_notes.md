# alternating.c

printfs don't need to be protected with a semaphore -- make a comment,
but no need to take off points.

# coffee_break.c

some solutions are correct but more complicated -- feel free to
comment on the existence of simpler solutions, but no need to take off points

# order.c

some solutions use redundant semaphores -- comment on these, but no
need to take off points

several busy waiting solutions -- if a semaphore is used to proect a
global variable make sure it actually functions properly.
