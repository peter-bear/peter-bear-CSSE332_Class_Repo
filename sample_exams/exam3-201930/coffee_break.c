/*

  In this problem there are 2 workers who work for a while and then
  take a coffe break together.  When they are both finished with their
  coffee, they resume working.  This cycle repeats.

  Neither worker should actually take a coffee break until both are ready.
  Neither worker should resume work until both are finished with their coffee.

  Use semaphores to ensure these constraints are met.

  Example output:

Worker A is working
Worker B is working
Worker A is ready for a coffee break
Worker B is ready for a coffee break
Worker B is taking a coffee break
