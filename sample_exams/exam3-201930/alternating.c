/* 
   In this system there are two kinds of threads - red threads and
   black threads.  All of the threads need to enter a critical
   section.  Only one thread may be in the critical section at once
   but there is an additional rule - the two types of threads must
   alternate - red black red black etc.  If a red thread finishes it
   does not matter which of the waiting black threads are selected to
   go next (and the same is true for reds after a black finish).

   Red should be the first color to enter the critical section.

   Example output:

red thread 0 entering critical section
red thread 0 leaving critical section
black thread 0 entering critical section
black thread 0 leaving critical section
red thread 1 entering critical section
red thread 1 leaving critical section
black thread 1 entering critical section
black thread 1 leaving critical section
red thread 2 entering critical section
red thread 2 leaving critical section
black thread 2 entering critical section
black thread 2 leaving critical section
red thread 3 entering critical section
red thread 3 leaving critical section
black thread 3 entering critical section
black thread 3 leaving critical section
done


Note: my example output happens to be in numerical order but that is
not required, only the alternating is requried.
