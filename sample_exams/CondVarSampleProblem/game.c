/**
 * In this problem, we are implementing a system that starts and ends a soccer 
 * game between Liverpool and Manchester United. 
 * There are four types of players: goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders, and 
 * attackers, and we have one referee. 
 * Assume that both teams adopt a similar strategy and decide to have the
 * following approach:
 * - 1 goalkeeper
 * - 4 defenders
 * - 4 midfielders
 * - 2 attackers.
 * 
 * 16 players (4 of each kind) from each team arrive, and we only need to let 
 * a portion of them on the field, according to the above strategy. 
 * 
 * If a player arrives and there are already enough players of the same kind,
 * that player goes back home (i.e., does a `return NULL;`). For example, if 4
 * defenders from Liverpool have arrived, the 5th defender to arrive will simply
 * go home and return.
 * 
 * The referee will wait until BOTH teams have fully arrived, i.e., 11 players
 * from Liverpool and 11 players from Man Utd. Once both teams have arrived, the
 * referee will blow the whistle and start the game. The referee will sleep
 * for 2 seconds to represent the game. All players (there's 22 of them now)
 * should wait until the final whistle to end the game. In other words, after
 * the starting whistle, the players will wait for the referee's final whistle
 * signaling that they can go home. 
 * 
 * Implement the semantics of this game using condition variables and mutex
 * locks.
