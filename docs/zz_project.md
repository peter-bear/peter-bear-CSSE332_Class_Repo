# Introduction
In this lab, you will learn to write a kernel module that allows you to set and
read values from an array of integers. A Linux kernel module is a piece of code
that is dynamically inserted into a running Linux kernel, and allows you to do
a plethora of useful interactions, such as interface with hardware, control the
execution of processes, and even write a rootkit. 

<!--
In this project, we will write a kernel module that allows us to turn our
operating system into a _real-time operating system_ for a short period of time,
and a for a specific set of processes. In other words, our module will take care
of keeping track of running processes, monitoring their status, and scheduling
them to meet some real time guarantees. Eventually, our module will run a
_rate-monotonic scheduler_ (RMS) that assigns priorities to running processes,
decide when to accept or reject incoming processes, and preempt a running
process in case one with higher priority shows up. This project will be
organized in 3 to 4 milestones, depending on how our quarter goes.  But let's
put that the side for now, and focus on getting our feet wet with kernel modules
development. 
-->

## Learning objectives
At the end of this lab, we will answer the following questions:
1. How does Linux allow for the extension of the operating system? Do we have to
   recompile and reinstall every time?
1. What skills do I need to brag to my friends that I can write kernel code?
1. How do processes talk to a kernel module? And how can we read and write to
   the module?

## Logistics
* **Starter code**: None. Wait what? Yup, you read it right. There is no starter
code in this project. You will write things from scratch! (Well that's a lie,
but you will have to set up your directory structure and create your files - you
should be able to do this by now, right?)
* [Submission
box](https://moodle.rose-hulman.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=2933575&forceview=1)
* **Due date**: Thursday September 23, 11:59 pm

## Developmental setups
There are two things I would like to bring to your attention before we get
started. 

### Virtual machines
For this project, we will be doing our development using a Linux virtual
machine. If you have not set yours up yet, then please do so ASAP. You can use
whichever Linux flavor that works best for you. 

However, **PLEASE** (**PLEASE** **PLEASE**^100) make sure you have a backup of
your assignment code (either somewhere else or better yet, on a git repo). We
will brick our virtual machine several times throughout the life of this
lab, and data loss is possible. Therefore, make sure you have your code
backed up somewhere!

Virtual machines provide for a very useful feature: taking snapshots. You can,
at one moment of time, take a snapshot of your virtual machine and then, if
things go bad, you can always recover your machine's state from that snapshot
(kinda like a context switch right?). I do not anticipate that we will need to
do so in this class, as most of our bugs should be resolved by a quick forced
reboot, it is however good to always have a backup, so I suggest you make use
of this functionality. 

### Maintaining your code
Please make sure to create a **PRIVATE** repo of your source code for this
project. I do not recommend that you use the course repository for that, as you
can quickly clog it up. Instead, please create a new git repo for this project,
and add your partner(s) and myself (my GitHub ID is `nouredd2`) as
collaborators. Adding me is optional, yet it allows me to take a look at your
code whenever you need me or would like to ask me questions. 

# Linux kernel modules
Linux is a monolithic kernel, i.e., the entirety of the kernel executes as a
logical single process and in a single address space. Which means that, in
Linux, all of the illusionist, referee, and glue roles occur in the same address
space, which makes things run faster and communicate much more easily. This is
in contrast to a microkernel where the functionality of the operating system is
broken down into several isolated processes (sometimes called servers). The
microkernel approach tends to sacrifice performance for the ability to isolate
services, i.e., if the schedule crashes, it can be rebooted without
contaminating the memory space the file system. You can read more about these
two choices in the famous Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanenbaum%E2%80%93Torvalds_debate) and
[here](https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/appa.html).

However, in order to also protect against the disadvantages of monolithic
kernels, the Linux kernel provides support for _kernel threads_, the ability to
preempt itself (called _kernel preemption_), and a modular design that supports
the loading and unloading of additional pieces of software, called
__modules__.

> (**Definition**) Kernel module: A piece of code than can be added to the
  kernel at runtime. 

## Why modules?
Imagine you are running a version of Linux and you are quite happy with it, but
then you decide to purchase a new gaming controller, or a new recording device
(let's stick with the controller so I don't have to write everything twice).
Your controller is designed by a fancy new company and they decided that their
devices will adhere to a completely new communication protocol that they
invented, let's call it _WeKnowBetterProtocol_.  So you decide to plug your
controller in through USB, and then nothing happens! Well, the current version
of Linux you have does not speak _WeKnowBetterProtocol_, so your controller at
this point is pretty much useless. How do we fix that?

Well one thing we can do is to throw away our entire operating system, add to it
support for _WeKnowBetterProtocol_, recompile it, and then install the new
version. That doesn't sound like fun, right? Fortunately, Linux provides with a
very useful feature: _kernel modules_. The developer of _WeKnowBetterProtocol_
can write a module for their controller that allows the kernel to understand
_WeKnowBetterProtocol_ and then magically, and at runtime, insert (or install)
the module into your current Linux kernel. Nifty isn't it?

The Linux kernel offers support for a range of types (or classes) of kernel
modules, including, but not limited to, device drives. You can even add a new
filesystem as a kernel module! Well, maybe next year!

The figure above (obtained from [Linux Device Drivers, 3rd
Edition](https://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/)) shows a sample organization of the Linux
kernel, including tasks that are implemented as kernel modules.

# Lab 0
In this lab, we will implement a kernel module that simply manages an array of
integers. The module will interact with user processes and allow them to insert
entries into the array. It will also allow users to read the content of the
array, both in full and entry by entry. The module will make any changes to the
array persistent, i.e., if one process changes the element at index `i`, then
another process reading the array must see those changes (we will worry about
concurrency issues in milestone 2 -- exciting stuff!). We will allows processes
to communicate with our kernel module by using `procfs`, a pseudo-filesystem
(i.e., does not really exist on disk, only in memory) that allows us to treat
our module as if it was a file we can read and write to!

## Baby: Hello World! kernel module
Okay, time to flex our kernel coding muscles and get busy coding our first
kernel module. This will simply be a module that  prints `Module csse332
initializing...` upon entry, and `Module csse332 exiting...` upon exit. Entry?
Exit? Printing? What do those mean?

### Anatomy of a module
Our operating system kernel is already running, so what does it mean to add
another piece of code to it dynamically? Well, the kernel is well-equipped to
handle runtime addition of code. To support that, it allows developers to insert
modules into the kernel using the `insmod` command. Once a module is inserted
into the kernel, the kernel will run some initialization code, and using the
concept of [callbacks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/callbacks-in-c/), the
kernel can ask the module if it wants to run some of its own initialization
code. 

So, no `main` function. You just need to point the kernel to what you would like
your module to do upon initialization, and the kernel will make sure that
executes for you!

Similarly, the kernel allows you to remove modules. Once is a module is set to
be removed, the kernel will ask the module if it likes to run any cleanup code.
All you have to do again is to point the kernel to which function you'd like to
execute when exiting, and the kernel will call that for you.  Nice isn't it?

### Printing in the kernel
We mentioned printing, but where does the kernel print? Does it use the same
`printf` functions we use when writing user applications. Well, not exactly. The
kernel writes to its own "files" and have specific commands that allow you to
see those printed messages. However, since the kernel must be running with
performance in mind, it tends to rate-limit your print messages so that you
don't end up blocking the entire kernel while waiting for I/O operations to
finish. 

Luckily, the Linux kernel is well-equipped to allow us to log important messages. To that extent,
the kernel provides us with the function `printk` (k standing for kernel, genius right?). `printk`
messages are printed to a kernel log buffer, that can be accessed from userspace by reading
`/dev/kmsg`. Also, luckily, we can use the `dmesg` utility to see the kernel's log messages on our
console. 

However, unlike `printf`, `printk` requires us to provide a logging level. For
example, printing at the info level can be done using
```
   printk(KERN_INFO "My message is %s\n", "Hello world!);
 ```
The kernel has several log levels (`KERN_EMERG`, `KERN_ALERT`, `KERN_CRIT`,
etc.), and depending on how you configure your logging levels, not all messages
will be printed. For example, if I choose to print at the debug-level using
`KERN_DEBUG`, the kernel will by default ignore those messages since it is not
configured to print debug information when it is in release mode. In this
project, we will mostly rely on info-level messages since we are writing a small
light-weight module. However, be aware that if you use `printk` inside of a
loop, the kernel might limit your printing to avoid blocking the kernel for I/O
operations. 

I bet you are wondering now if we have to write this long and ugly line every
time we need to print a statement? Well, luckily not! The kernel developers
have kindly provided us with a set of aliases that are much more elegant. For
example, to print at the info-level, we can simply use the `pr_info` alias,
which simply calls the appropriate `printk` message for us!

Even better, we can customize the output of `pr_info` to print a prefix message
that will allow us to identify that it is our module who's printing. That will
be very helpful when looking at our debug messages so that we can easily find
them in the bulk of messages that the other kernel services print. 

### Time to get started
Let's start by creating a file to start writing our code. You can call it
whatever you like. In the rest of this section, I assume the name of the file is
`project.c`.

Alright, with that being said, let's write our first module. First, let's ask
the kernel to prepend our module's name to every print message. To do that, put
this line at the top of your source code
```c
#define pr_fmt(fmt) "[csse332]: " fmt
```
This will tell the kernel the prepend `[csse332]: ` to every message that we
print from our module. 

Okay, time to include the files we care about. In this section, I will provide
you with the files you need to include, but after that, you're on your own. So
let's go ahead and include the following files
```c
#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/printk.h>
```
Pretty much self explanatory right? **NOTE** that you do not have access to the
standard `libc` libraries (like `stdio.h` and `string.h` and so on). You can
only work with what the kernel provides you with (there might be some caveats,
but let's ignore those for now). 

Okay, now let's give some descriptive information of our kernel. We will set its
description, its author, and its license as follows:
```c
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
MODULE_AUTHOR("YOUR NAMES GO HERE");
MODULE_DESCRIPTION("DESCRIBE WHAT YOUR MODULE DOES HERE!");
```

Awesome! So now that we have gotten bookkeeping out of the way, let's get to the
meat of this. First let's write our initialization and exit functions. For our
initialization function, let's write it as follows
```c
static int
__init csse_init(void)
{
    pr_info("Module csse332 initializing...\n");
    /* return a non zero value if failure occurs */
    return 0;
}
```
You can see that we used `static` and `__init` in that function's signature.
What do those mean?  `static` tells our compiler that the scope of this function
is only to be kept in this file (i.e., we do not want to export it to other
files or scopes). The `__init` attribute informs our compiler that this function
shall only be run once when the kernel loads the module, therefore it can free
up the space occupied by the function after the first time the kernel loads it. 

Similarly, let's write our exit function:
```c
static void
__exit csse_exit(void)
{
    pr_info("Module csse332 exiting...\n");
    /* Do exit stuff here... */
}
```
You can see that this is a mirror image of the initialization function except
the fact that it returns nothing (i.e., `void`). Note that it is important that
your initialization function to return 0 ONLY when the initialization is
successful. If you do not return an error code when an error is encountered, you
might risk polluting your kernel's memory and crashing your machine. 

Okay, so we have written our initialization and exit functions, the only thing
we have left is to inform the kernel of them. To do so, we can use the
`module_init` and `module_exit` macros as follows
```
 module_init(csse_init);
 module_exit(csse_exit);
```

Great, that's it! That's your first module. Congratulations!!!

#### Compiling your module
Now that we have written our first module, we need to compile it so that we can
insert it into our kernel. To do so, we will again call on the help of the
`make` tool by writing a `Makefile`, which will look as follows:
```
CONFIG_MODULE_SIG=n

obj-m += project.o

all:
  make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) modules

clean:
  make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) clean
```
That's it! The first line turns off signature verification for our module. This
is a security feature to verify that the module is indeed written by those who
claim they have written it (Imagine you can get a driver that you assume to be
from NVIDIA but turns out to be from SUPER\_NASTY\_HACKER, that would be bad if
you plug that code into your kernel wouldn't it be?).  Luckily, we don't have to
worry about this in this class. 

The line `obj-m += project.o` is where we tell `make` to compile our `project.c`
file into its corresponding object file (make sure you adjust this if you chose
a different one). Then the last two lines make use of the makefiles located in
your own Linux distribution to perform the correct build steps. There are more
options we can specify, but for this class, that's all we need to do!

If your compilation fails due to missing files, make sure you install the Linux
kernel heads for your kernel version. On Ubuntu, you can do so using
```shell
sudo apt install -y linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

#### Testing your module
Alright, now go ahead and build your module using
```shell
make
```
If all goes well, you shouldn't see any error messages showing up. There will be
a bunch of files created, the only one we care about is the file `project.ko`,
that is our module that we would like to insert into the kernel. 

Next, let's insert our module into the kernel. To do so, use the command
```shell
sudo insmod project.ko
```
If all goes well, you shouldn't see anything popping up. So how do we confirm
that everything is going well? Now comes the time to play some tricks. 

First, let's confirm that the module has been inserted. To do so, use the
following command
```shell
lsmod | grep project
```
You should see your module pop out along with some information that we're not
going to worry about for now, so something that looks like the following
```
project                16384  0
```
Great so we know our module has been inserted, let's check if we printed our
hello message. To do so, let's use `dmesg` as follows:
```shell
dmesg 
```
That will dump everything that the kernel has written so far. It's a long list,
so can we manipulate it a bit more? Of course we can! Recall that little message
we prepended  to the start of all our kernel printouts? Let's ask `dmesg` to
only show kernel messages that start with that prefix. To do so, use
```shell
dmesg | grep csse332
```
Do not use the brackets here, as that will cause your command to fail (to see
why, lookup regular expressions!). If all goes well, you should see something
that looks as follows
```
[   50.644180] [csse332]: Module csse 332 initializing...
```

Now, let's remove our module and make sure we are printing the exit message. To
do so, use 
```shell
sudo rmmod project
```
And let's confirm again using `dmesg`
```
dmesg | grep csse332
```
and you should see something that looks as follows:
```
[  359.817310] [csse332]: Module csse 332 exiting...
```

Congratulations! You have inserted your first kernel module and are well on your
way to become a kernel hacker!

# Toddler: Step 1: Memory allocation
In the first step of this lab, we would like to create an array of integers of
size 10. Your module should allocate memory in the kernel for this array, and
then free it up when it exits (either normally or because of an error). 

## Memory management
To create memory in user applications, we used the `malloc` function. Is there
something similar to that in the kernel? Of course! And unsurprisingly, the
function is called `kmalloc`! However, since kernel memory is managed
differently than user memory, we need to tell the kernel what kind of memory
we're allocating and in which context. Therefore, we will use
```c
kmalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL)
```
The `size` parameter behaves in the same way as the normal `malloc` parameter.
The second parameter we're passing, `GFP_KERNEL`, tells the kernel that the
memory allocated is to be used in kernel space, in the kernel context. You can
check more information about the possible flags to `kmalloc`
[here](https://www.kernel.org/doc/htmldocs/kernel-api/API-kmalloc.html).

Your job in this step is to make sure that the memory is allocated when
initializing the module and then it is freed when the module is exiting (or
later on, when any errors occur during initialization). 

To make sure that everything went smoothly, try printing out a few elements of
the array during initialization to make sure that your module is behaving
correctly. As always, use
* `isnmod` to insert your module,
* `lsmod` to check if your module is inserted,
* `dmesg` to read kernel messages, and
* `rmmod` to remove your module. 

# Preschool: Step 2: Your module learns to talk 
So our module now maintains an array of integers as a data structure. Great! But
what use is this data structure for us if we cannot read and write to it? In
this step, we will need to allow users to communicate with our module using the
`procfs` pseudo filesystem. 

## Create a directory entry for our module
First, we need to create an entry for our module in `procfs`. Our goal is to
create an entry for our module under `/proc/csse332/status`. You can think of it
as a file to and from which our user applications can write and read. Note that
this is all managed in software! Nothing that you will do will be written or
read from disk!

First, we need to create the parent directory `csse332` for our module in
`procfs`. To do so, you can use the `proc_mkdir` call as follows:
```c
parent_entry = proc_mkdir("csse332", NULL);
/* do some error checking on parent entry here and check that all is good.
 * if not, make sure you do some appropriate cleanup!
 */
```
Your job is to answer the following questions:
1. Where should this piece of code go in your code?
1. What is the return type of `proc_mkdir`? And where do I declare the variable
   that will hold that entry?
1. What should you do if the creation of the entry fails? (_hint_: Recall that
   if have allocated anything, it must be free appropriately!)
1. Finally, when should we cleanup and remove our entry?

Note that the final question is very important. If you fail to cleanup after
yourself (i.e., remove your created directory when needed, you won't be able to
insert your module again). So go back to the drawing board and answer the above
questions before you start writing your code. 

To test that your code is working correctly, insert your module using `insmod`
and then check that there a directory created under `/proc`. You can simply use 
```shell
ls /proc
```
to see all files and directories under `procfs`. 

## Create a file for our module
Awesome, so we have created our directory, now it's time to create our
pseudo-file under our directory. To do so, we will use the `proc_create` call.
We would like to create an entry called `status` under the `csse332` directory
we created in the previous step. So the path to our entry would be
`proc/csse332/status`. **Please make sure you stick to the same naming
convention as this document, otherwise, it will break our grading setup.** Here
is the signature of the function
```c
struct proc_dir_entry *proc_create(
  const char *name, umod_t mode, struct proc_dir_entry *parent,
  const struct file_operations *proc_fops);
```
where
* `name` is the name of your entry to create
* `mode` are your entry's permissions (i.e., who can read/write/execute it). For
this project, we will allow users to read and write to our entry, so use `0666`
as your permissions! And no we're not summoning Satan, at least not yet!
* `parent` is the parent directory of our entry, which is the directory we
created previously!
* `proc_fops` are the operations that your module would support (such as reading
and writing).


So the first parameters sound reasonable, but what the heck is the last one,
`proc_fops`? Where do we get that one from. Well, you're going to have to create
it! That is the crux of this assignment. The `struct file_operations` structure
is simply a structure of function pointers that you must set so that your users
can read and write to the `procfs` entry for your module. You can find more
information about the content of this structure
[here](https://tldp.org/LDP/lkmpg/2.4/html/c577.htm). Note that you do NOT have
to implement all of the functions for this entry. In this step, we will focus on
the `read` and `write` callbacks. Any time a user tries to read from your
`procfs` entry, the operating system will magically figure out that it must call
your `read` function. Similarly, any time a user writes to your `procfs` entry,
the OS will magically figure out that is must call your `write` function. 

To help you get started, I have provided you with empty stubs that allow you to
successfully create your `procfs` entry and test it out. 

**NOTE**: It appears that as of Linux version 5.6, the signature of the above function has changed
to accept a `const struct proc_ops *proc_fops` instead of the `const struct file_operations
*proc_fops` that we show above. To handle this issue, first check what your kernel version is. To do
so, use the command
```shell
uname -r
```

        .proc_read  = csse332_read,
        .proc_write = csse332_write,
};
```


Now you know that you can create your `procfs` entry by passing the address of
`csse332_fops` as the last parameter to your `proc_create` function. 

Finally, recall that anything you create or allocate, you must destroy or free.
So make sure that you appropriate delete your `procfs` entry and directory
before your module exits. Again, failure to do will stop you from inserting your
module again for testing!

Go ahead and create the entry, then verify that you can read and write to it (Of
course, nothing will happen at this point, but make sure that no errors show
up). After inserting your module, you can test the `write` handler using
```shell
echo "hello" > /proc/csse332/status
```
and you can test your `read` handler using
```shell
cat /proc/csse332/status
```
If no errors show up, you are good to go to the next step!

## Learning to write: The write handler
First let's busy ourselves with the `write` handler. In this milestone, we would
want the user to give us two parameters as a command: (1) the index at which we
would want to write into our array, and (2) the value they would like to write
at the position. Your job is to parse the user's command and then write the
value that the user requested at the specific index. Of course, if the user
sends an invalid index, you must notify them appropriately (by returning an
appropriate error code).

To make things easier, you may assume that the user always send in valid
commands. In other words, all inputs from the user are simply two
space-separated numbers, the first of which is the index they wish to write at,
and the second is the value they would like to write to the array. Assume that
all commands from the user are correctly formatted. 

But before we start writing code, did you see that `__user` attribute before the
`buff` parameters to the `csse332_write` function? What does that mean?

Simply, this means that the memory area that `buff` occupies is in user land.
But where is your module running? Right, in kernel space! So can your module
directly access memory from the user space? Heck no! All hell would break loose
if you do (try it! bad things will happen, and it will be ugly -- well I
exaggerate a little, but **NEVER** read or write directly to user land from
the kernel).  Okay, so what do we do? Well, luckily, the kernel provides us
with a mechanism to copy data from the user space to the kernel space. That
function is surprisingly called, `copy_from_user` (you can check out its
documentation
[here](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/teaching/lectures/opsys/13_14/docs/kernelAPI/r4081.html)).
Therefore, before you do anything, you must first copy the message from the user
space to the kernel space appropriately. 

Here are the steps I suggest you do when implementing this step:
1. Allocate memory in kernel space to hold the user's message.
1. Using `copy_from_user`, copy the data from the user buffer to your kernel
   buffer.  Make sure you do appropriate error checking and return error codes
   if your code fails. 
   > Note: Recall that C strings should always be terminated with a `\0`
     character. So make sure to make enough room in your kernel buffer to hold
     that character as well. `copy_from_user` is not guaranteed to copy that
     character for you so make sure you add it manually. 

   > Note 2: you might find it useful to remove any `\n` characters from your
     kernel buffer, as it can simplify parsing the command. 
1. Parse the user's command. You might find the function `sscanf` from
   `linux/string.h` useful for you. 
1. After parsing the command from the user, you will end up with two integers,
   the index and the value to write. 
1. Check that the index that the user passed to you is valid (i.e., is not
   negative and is not out of bounds). If the index is not valid, return an
   appropriate error code to the user and cleanup after yourself. You can find a
   list of useful error code
   [here](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.15/media/uapi/gen-errors.html).
   Note that you must always return a negative integer on error, i.e., you must
   use `return -ENOMEM` to indicate insufficient memory. 
1. If the index is valid, write the user's value at that specific index into the
   array of integers. 
1. Exit from the function after cleaning everything up. Make sure you do
   appropriate cleanup every single time, a single leaky pointer or buffer
   overflow can crash your machine :( 

You do not need to worry about the offset `offp` in writing, you will take care
of that in the `read` handler in the next step!

Test your code by inserting your module into the kernel and then trying to write
to it. For example, to write the value 10 at index 5, use
```shell
echo "5 10" > /proc/csse332/status
```
Then check `dmesg` to see if your code is behaving correctly. Also, make sure to
test for out of bounds input commands and make sure your code is correctly
handling those!

## Learning to read: The read handler
Finally, it is time to teach our module to read (it is actually the user who is
reading from the module's proc entry, but let's just use the same terminology so
we don't get confused). When the user tries to read your module's `procfs`
entry, your module should return the content of the integer array stored in the
module. However, it **MUST** return the elements one entry at a time. In other
words, as long as there are elements in the array, the user should keep asking
you to read until your return 0  (Recall that the `read` handler returns 0
**only** where there are no more things to read from your module's `procfs`
entry). 

But how do we know which entry did the user read last? Well this is where the
`offp` pointer comes in handy. In this project, we will not allow the user to
skip entries when reading, so we can always assume that the first time the user
calls `read`, the offset is 0. (note that `loff_t` is nothing but a `long long
int` in most modern machines). 

After opening your `procfs` entry, the `offp` pointer will persist across
multiple read operations (again, we will not allow users to change that, though
in real life, they can using the `seek` calls, but let's ignore those for now).
So think about how you can use the `offp` pointer to track how many entries has
the user read so far, and then to figure out when you should return 0 to
indicate that there are no more elements to read. Could `offp` serves as a
pointer to the index you are currently reading from? 

Similarly to the `write` handler, it is not a good idea to directly write to the
user's buffer.  Instead, we will make use of `copy_to_user` to copy data from
the kernel space to the user space.  Here's how I would suggest your approach
this step:
1. Allocate space in the kernel's memory to hold your message
1. Try to write a simple "Hello from module read" into that kernel buffer
1. Copy the kernel buffer to the user space buffer using `copy_to_user` and
   check for any errors (check if the user's buffer has enough room for your
   message, i.e., if the `count` parameter indicates that the user has enough
   room to hold your message). 
1. Return 0 to tell the user to stop reading
1. Test your code using `cat /proc/csse332/status` and make sure you can see the
   message from your module. 

Once you have the above working, now is the time to implement your array reading
logic. Note that `cat` will keep reading from your `procfs` entry until you
return 0, so using `cat` to test the correctness is not going to cut it for this
step. You can use the user code below the test your code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <string.h>

int
main(int argc, char **argv)
{
        int fd, i;
        size_t nbytes;
        char buffer[1000];

        fd = open("/proc/csse332/status", O_RDONLY);
        if (fd < 0) {
                fprintf(stderr, "Could not open your the procfs entry for reading: %s\n",
                        strerror(errno));
                exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }

        for (i=0;i<12;++i) {
                nbytes = read(fd, buffer, 1000);
                if (nbytes > 0) {
                        printf("Read %lu bytes from procfs entry\n", nbytes);
                        printf("%s", buffer);
                } else {
                        printf("No more stuff to read at index %d\n", i);
                }
        }
}
```
You can change the number of iterations in the loop to make sure that you are
reading only the correct number of entries, and not all at once!
